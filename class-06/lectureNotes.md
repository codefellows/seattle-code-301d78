# Lecture Notes

## Axios
- a library that allows us to make web requests from inside our browser app
- a promise based HTTP client for the browser and NODE.js

## Async
- means asyncronous 
- a way to run code that takes a while without bogging down the execution of the rest of the code
- allows us to continue running code until we get back a response from that first function
- an alternative syntax for handling promises

## try and catch
- a language feature that sets us up with a backup behavior in case the try fails
``` js
try {
  run some code her
} catch (error) {
  console.error(error);
}
```
